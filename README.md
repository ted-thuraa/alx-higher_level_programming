## Introduction


Each directory contains the high level projects and code that I wrote during my time at Holberton. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects were to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind python, abstraction, and databases. There is info and trivia questions that I go over in each directory.

I will add stuff here later once it is done. This section is not complete.

## The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

      Beautiful is better than ugly.
      Explicit is better than implicit.
      Simple is better than complex.
      Complex is better than complicated.
      Flat is better than nested.
      Sparse is better than dense.
      Readability counts.
      Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
      Although practicality beats purity.
      Errors should never pass silently.
      Unless explicitly silenced.
      In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
      There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
      Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
      Now is better than never.
      Although never is often better than *right* now.
      If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
      If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
      Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
